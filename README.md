## Gaining insights from models

These are methods that work on already trained models. 
They can be used to determine which features are most important or what influence every single feature has on single or multiple predictions from a model.

These insights are for example valuable for assessing a model's accuracy or improve data cleanup and direct data elicitation.

A detailed description with examples is located [here](insights-from-models/README.md).
